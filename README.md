# Hexagon Detection with Normalized Cross Correlation in MATLAB

This project demonstrates how to detect repeated hexagon shapes in a given image using **normalized cross correlation** with MATLAB. The program extracts a template of a hexagon and locates its instances in the input image.

## üìÅ Files

- `MATLAB-Hexagon-Finder.m`: Main MATLAB script.
- `shape.bmp`: Source image that includes multiple hexagon shapes.
- `hexagon.bmp`: The extracted hexagon template used for matching.

## üß† Techniques Used

- Grayscale conversion using `rgb2gray()`
- Template creation from a region of interest
- Normalized cross-correlation with `normxcorr2()`
- Thresholding to identify matching regions
- Visualization using `text()` and `plot()` to mark matches

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Place `shape.bmp` and `hexagon_detection.m` in the same folder.
3. Run the script by typing:
```matlab
MATLAB-Hexagon-Finder
```
The program will:
- Show the original and template images
- Perform normalized cross correlation
- Mark detected hexagons with "+" symbols
- Display the number of detected hexagons

## üìå Note
The hexagon template is extracted once from the top-left 30√ó30 region of the image and saved as hexagon.bmp. You can modify this region if needed.

## üì∑ Example Output
- Hexagon matches marked in blue with "+"
- Correlation map shown
- Total count displayed on the final plot
